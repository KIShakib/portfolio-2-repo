            <p>I can conjur a website from nothing into existence, fully formed. I do not use tricks, nor is this magic. I specialize in manipulating the very fabric of the web, its raw materials of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG. Linux servers serve me, domains are my domain, and certificates are certain.I can plan, design, build, launch, and maintain a website myself.</p>
